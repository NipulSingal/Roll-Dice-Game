## Game Rules -

> The game has 2 players,playing in rounds

> In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score

> BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn

> The player can choose to 'HOLD', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn

> The first player who reaches 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
